This project was created for the [Weather App assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives and then expanded on it with my own concepts to make it more functional and user-friendly.
